## How to play
Create a game and use the given room id (see bottom left of the screen) to let people join your room.
After everybody has joined the creator of the room gets to decide the grid type.
Upload the images you desire to use into a public google drive folder, then right click the image you need and click share, then click "copy link" and paste it into the text field you can find to the right side of the screen, then select whether you want it to be the new background or a new token.
You can use the chat to simply send messages or send /d<number> to roll a dice with the given number of faces.
